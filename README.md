# MovieLister

## Synopsis

The basic idea is to able to load movie content from a desktop app to a mobile app(in this case I wanted to use a Smart TV using a external hard drive). The desktop app is made in python and the mobile app using android. 


## Motivation

I was bored to have to open the explorer and to look for the folder where my movies were, so just to simplify some steps I created this tools.

## Installation

For the app as I tested in a Smart TV and I couldn't found how to put it in debug mode, I had to install the apk manually, for this I needed to sign the app otherwise it couldn't be installed.
